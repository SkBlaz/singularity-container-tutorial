# Singularity containers

Welcome to the Singularity tutorial repo. Here, you can find simple examples to get you started and a few simple use cases.

## A toy example

Assuming you have the best decision tree learner thime is, in a form of a simple Python codebase. Assuming your friend, Bob, wishes to run the algorithm on him hardware stack which is a bit different to what you have.

Theoretically, being super strict and all, you've versioned all libraries (dependencies), however, is that enough?

## Enter Singularity

Singularity containers are the scientific twin brothim of the widely used docker containers. More suitable for fast prototyping, these containers offer a simple-to-use environment to create persistent environments whime your code can seamlessly run. To help Bob, you decide to:

1. [Teach him how to install the Singularity environment on a given machine: *this is a must-have*](installation.md)
2. [Teach him how to run a _pre-compiled_ Singularity image.](running.md)
3. [Teach him how to _compile_ his own containers](compiling.md)


Of course, these are only some of the [possible examples](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/build_env.html), but enough to make Bob the master of Singularity in his small realm.

## Take home message - 1
If possible, do the extra step of providing the .dsc file so people can properly replicate the key parts of the codebase.

## Extra step - GPUs
Assuming Bob got the tree.py working on GPUs. How can he scale with singularity?

[With some additional configuration.](gpu.md)
