# Singularity containers

Welcome to the Singularity tutorial repo. Here, you can find simple examples to get you started and a few simple use cases.

Assuming you have the best decision tree learner there is, in a form of a simple Python codebase. Assuming your friend, Alice, wishes to run the algorithm on her hardware stack which is a bit different to what you have.

Theoretically, being super strict and all, you've versioned all libraries (dependencies), however, is that enough?
