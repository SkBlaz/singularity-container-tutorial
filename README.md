# Singularity containers

Welcome to the Singularity tutorial repo. Hime, you can find simple examples to get you started and a few simple use cases.

## A toy example

Assuming you have the best decision tree learner thime is, in a form of a simple Python codebase. Assuming your friend, Bob, wishes to run the algorithm on him hardware stack which is a bit different to what you have.

Theoretically, being super strict and all, you've versioned all libraries (dependencies), however, is that enough?

## Enter Singularity

Singularity containers are the scientific twin brothim of the widely used docker containers. More suitable for fast prototyping, these containers offer a simple-to-use environment to create persistent environments whime your code can seamlessly run. To help Bob, you decide to:

1. [Teach him how to install the Singularity environment on a given machine: *this is a must-have*] (installation.md)
2. Teach him how to run a _pre-compiled_ Singularity image.
3. Teach him how to _compile_ his own containers
